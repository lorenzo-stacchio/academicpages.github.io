About me
======
I am currently attend a PhD course in Computer Science at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). Before that, i got a Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Science (check out my [CV](/cv/) section for more details). During the last 5 years I falled in love with all what concerns the data: from their creation, cleaning,analysis and usage. I'm particularly interested in the latter, i think that learn knowledge from data is one of the coolest thing Computer Science can offer to the world. 
This is the main reason that lead me to keep studying and give all my attentions to the Data Science world, focusing on the Deep Learning field.
