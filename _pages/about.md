Something more about me
======
I am currently attend a PhD course in Computer Science at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). Before, i got two degree in Computer Science in two different university. Check out my [CV](/cv/) section for more details. During the last 5 years I falled in love with all what concerns the data: from their creation, cleaning and analysis. However, i discovered that once data are formatted in a good manner it is possible to put to good use them to train Machine Learning models. When i discovered this world, i decided to keep studying it and for this reason i joined a PhD in Computer Science, which main research theme is Data Science, with particular focus on the Deep Learning field.
